Captive portal and NAT Firewall for linux
<p>
  This is a simple captive portal for linux. It may work on windows with WSL. 
  It took me 2 weeks to finish so I hope you like it. I wanted to make a better
  Wifi login system. I would like to thank ChatGPT for helping me.
  <br>To install type sudo ./install.sh
